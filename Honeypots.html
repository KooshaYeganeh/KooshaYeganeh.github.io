<p>To install Kippo, follow these steps to set it up on a Linux system. This guide assumes you’re using a Debian-based distribution like Ubuntu. Adjustments may be needed for other distributions.<br>
<strong>Kippo</strong> is a medium-interaction SSH honeypot designed to simulate a vulnerable Linux system, primarily to attract, log, and analyze brute-force attacks, unauthorized access attempts, and the activities of attackers once they gain access. It’s particularly useful for understanding attack techniques, collecting malicious IP addresses, and gathering intelligence on the tools and commands used by attackers.</p>
<h3 id="how-kippo-works"><strong>How Kippo Works</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>SSH Simulation</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kippo listens on a designated port (usually port 22) and simulates an SSH server. Attackers attempting to brute-force SSH credentials will be interacting with Kippo, thinking they have gained access to a real system.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fake File System</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Once attackers log in, they are presented with a fake file system that mimics a real Linux environment. This file system is not actually tied to the host machine, so attackers can’t damage or alter the real system.</li>
<li>The fake file system includes typical directories and files that an attacker might expect to find, such as <code>/etc/passwd</code>, <code>/bin/</code>, <code>/usr/</code>, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Logging and Session Recording</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kippo logs every command entered by the attacker and the responses returned by the system, providing a detailed record of the attacker’s activities.</li>
<li>It also records sessions, which can be replayed later to analyze the behavior of the attacker.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Customizable Environment</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kippo allows users to customize the fake file system and command responses. For instance, specific files can be set up to contain fake sensitive information to lure attackers into interacting with them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Attack Simulation</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the attacker tries to download and execute malicious files, Kippo allows the download to proceed but captures the file for analysis. The execution of the file is simulated, but it never actually runs on the real system, ensuring the host remains secure.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Interaction with Attackers</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kippo simulates a fully interactive shell, allowing attackers to navigate the system, view files, and execute commands as if they were on a real system.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="features-of-kippo-honeypot"><strong>Features of Kippo Honeypot</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>SSH Brute Force Protection</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kippo is highly effective at attracting and logging SSH brute-force attacks, making it a valuable tool for understanding these common attack vectors.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Full Session Logging</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Every session initiated by an attacker is logged in detail, including the commands entered, outputs returned, and files accessed. This helps in analyzing attacker behavior and techniques.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fake File System</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The fake file system is one of Kippo’s key features. It mimics a real Linux file system, tricking attackers into thinking they have compromised a real server.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Session Replay</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kippo includes tools to replay attacker sessions, allowing security researchers to review and analyze the attack in a controlled manner.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Attack Data Collection</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Files downloaded by attackers (e.g., malicious scripts, rootkits) are captured by Kippo for further analysis, without actually compromising the host system.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Customizable Environment</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The honeypot’s environment, including the fake file system and command outputs, can be customized to better mimic specific targets or to lure attackers into specific behaviors.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Community and Support</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kippo was widely used and had an active community, leading to various enhancements and tools being developed to work with it. However, it is worth noting that Kippo is no longer actively maintained, and its successor, <strong>Cowrie</strong>, has taken over with more features and improvements.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Open Source</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kippo is open-source, allowing users to modify and extend it according to their needs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="transition-to-cowrie"><strong>Transition to Cowrie</strong></h3>
